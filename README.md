# Image-classification by CNN
In case robot could not read the door number correctly, there should be another backup solution for recognizing whether the door it is looking at has a number or not. To help robot for classifying a guest room accurately, building a Convolutional neural network (CNN) model could be beneficial to assist robot to achieve this goal due to its feature in using convolution and max-pooling layers to extract features and reduce dimensionality.
